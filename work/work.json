      "date": "September '17 - Present",
      "description": "Referring Expression Generation is a Machine Learning problem where, given an image with some objects and a bounding box around one of those objects, the ML system generates a natural language expression to uniquely identify that object. My team and I have been working on replacing the objective function of the existing state of the art system for this problem with an objective function that places more emphasis on the semantic meaning of the expressions in the training data, rather than the raw words in these expressions. We are working on a submission for NIPS by June.",

The inner cylinder could store something precious, like a message or a small meaningful object.",

A starting tone will play and the LED will blink green for a few seconds, indicating that the game has now begun. Henceforth, when the LED flashes green, the players have to race to click on their button - whoever clicks first gets a point signaled by the LED changing to the color of that player's button. If you click without seeing the LED flash green you hear a reprimanding tone and the opposing team gets a point - signaled again by the LED changing to the opposing team’s color. The first team to 5 points wins - and when this happens a winning tone is played accompanied by the LED blinking the winning team’s color for a few seconds.",
