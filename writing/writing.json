      "description": "In my senior thesis I try and conceptualize privacy in term's of technology's relationship with it. I construct a lens through which to think about the privacy implications of any new technology. I use this lens to discuss the portable Camera of the late 19th century, the Telephone of the early 20th century, the GPS of the mid-20th century and the Internet. I worked on this for the whole of my senior year as an undergraduate.",
