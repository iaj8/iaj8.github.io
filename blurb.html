      Hello! My name is Ishaan. I am a computer scientist with experience in Machine Learning, Natural Language Processing,
      Networks, Cybersecurity and Technology Law. My primary interest is investigating
      the influence technology systems have on news and the spread of information through society.
      <br>
      <br>
      I am currently a Data Journalism intern on the Special Projects Desk at Gizmodo Media Group.
      I have a BA and M.Eng. from Cornell University in Computer Science where my graduate research focused on the
      intersection between Computer Vision and Natural Language Processing. As an undergraduate, I wrote
      a thesis on how technology has informed society's understanding of privacy from the 19th century
      to the present day.
      I have lived in India, England, upstate New York and now the Lower East Side of Manhattan.

      I am also involved in an art project called <i>cat's cradle</i> with
      <a href="https://vimeo.com/111283883" target="_blank">Lilla LoCurto and Bill Outcault</a> in Brooklyn,
      where I help with hardware and Artificial Intelligence.
