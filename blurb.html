  <h3>About Me</h3>
  <p id="blurbTextArea">
      I am a computer scientist with experience in Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing and
      a rapidly growing interest in journalism. I have lived in India, England and now upstate New York.
      I am studying for a Masters of Engineering in Computer Science. I am primarily interested in studying
      the influence technology systems have on news and the spread of information through society.
      <br>
      I am currently working on INSERT MENG PROJECT HERE.
      When I am not working, I am usually tinkering around in Cornellâ€™s Rapid Prototyping Lab
      or trying to find anyone at all to go bird watching with me.
