      Hello! My name is Ishaan. The greatest moment of my life was when the 
      <a href="https://www.economist.com/united-states/2020/06/13/a-birdwatchers-app-inspires-a-field-guide-to-protesters-symbols" target="_blank">Economist</a> 
      referred to me as 
      "Mr Jhaveri, an amateur birdwatcher".
      <br>
      <br>
      I am a writer and computer scientist (and bird photographer!) with experience in Machine Learning, Computer Vision,
      Natural Language Processing, Networks, Cybersecurity, Technology Law, OSINT, and Full-Stack, Android
      and iOS Development. I currently work as a Computational Research Fellow at the Tow Center for
      Digital Journalism at Columbia University's Graduate School of Journalism, but <b>I am looking for
      a new job</b> after my fellowship finishes on July 21st, 2021.
      <br>
      <br>
      Since April 2019 I have primarily worked on a project called
      <a href="https://www.niemanlab.org/2020/06/vizpol-takes-a-cue-from-bird-watching-apps-to-help-journalists-identify-unfamiliar-political-symbols/" target="_blank">VizPol</a>,
      an app designed to provide journalists with contextual information about unfamiliar graphic symbols 
      they may encounter during field reporting, especially during live events, protests, and rallies. 
      By offering journalists some additional information about these symbols 
      (or just alerting them to the fact that a symbol may have broader political connotations) the 
      VizPol app supports more accurate, effective reporting on an increasingly complex political landscape.
      <br>
      <br>
      My work on VizPol has drawn me to visual reporting and leveraging open-source intelligence (OSINT) techniques. I 
      took an OSINT course with <a href="https://www.bellingcat.com/"target="_blank">Bellingcat</a> in 
      June 2020. Moving forward I am particularly interested in reporting on protests, continuing to build computational tools to
      help journalists report on protests and other types of visual reporting, and studying the use of visual and 
      computer vision technologies in newsrooms.
      <br>
      <br>
      I have a BA and M.Eng. from Cornell University in Computer Science (with a minor in English).
      After graduating in 2018 I interned as a 
      <a href="https://kinja.com/ishaanjhaveri" target="_blank">Data Journalist</a>
      on the Special Projects Desk at
      Gizmodo Media Group (now called G/O Media).
      <br>
      <br>
      I have lived in India, England, upstate New York, New York City and currently Venice Beach, Los Angeles.
