      Hello! My name is Ishaan. I am a computer scientist with experience in Machine Learning,
      Natural Language Processing, Networks, Cybersecurity, Technology Law, and Full-Stack, Android
      and iOS Development. I am interested in investigating the influence technology systems have
      on news and the spread of information through society.

      Since October 2018 I have been working as a Senior Research Fellow at the Tow Center for
      Digital Journalism at Columbia University's Graduate School of Journalism. Since April 2019
      I have been working on a project currently called the
      <a href="https://politicalvisualliteracy.github.io/" target="_blank">Political Visual Literacy app</a>.
      It is an app to help journalists and photojournalists that cover American political demonstrations.
      The app lets them reverse image search political symbols seen at demonstrations and gives them
      context about the group the symbol represents.

      I have a BA and M.Eng. from Cornell University in Computer Science (with a minor in English).
      After graduating in 2018 I interned as a Data Journalist on the Special Projects Desk at
      Gizmodo Media Group (now called G/O Media).
      <br>
      <br>
      I have lived in India, England, upstate New York and now Manhattan.
