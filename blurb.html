      Hello! My name is Ishaan. I am a computer scientist with experience in Machine Learning, 
      Natural Language Processing, Networks, Cybersecurity, Technology Law, and Full-Stack and 
      iOS Development. I am interested in investigating the influence technology systems have 
      on news and the spread of information through society.

      <br>      
      Since October 2018 I have been working as a Senior Research Fellow at the Tow Center for 
      Digital Journalism at Columbia University's Graduate School of Journalism. Since April 2019 
      I have been working on a project currently called the 
      <a href="https://politicalvisualliteracy.github.io/" target="_blank">Political Visual Literacy app</a>. 
      It is an app to help journalists and photojournalists covering American political demonstrations. 
      The app lets them reverse image search political symbols seen at demonstrations and gives them 
      context about the group the symbol represents.

      I have a BA and M.Eng. from Cornell University in Computer Science (with a minor in English). 
      At Cornell, as an undergraduate, I wrote a 
      <a href="http://ishaanjhaveri.com/writing/senior_thesis/thesis.pdf" target="_blank">thesis</a> 
      on how technology has informed society's understanding of privacy from the 19th century 
      to the present day. My 
      <a href="http://ishaanjhaveri.com/work/machine_learning/refexp-2.pdf" target="_blank"> graduate research </a>
      was in area at the intersection of Computer Vision 
      and Natural Language Processing called Referring Expression Generation (REG). 
      REG Systems take images as input and attempt to produce natural English 
      (or any other language) sentences to describe objects in the images. After graduating in 2018 
      I interned as a Data Journalist on the Special Projects Desk at Gizmodo Media Group.

      I have lived in India, England, upstate New York and now Manhattan.
      <br>

      In 2019 I was involved in an art installation called <i>cat's cradle</i> by artists 
      <a href="https://vimeo.com/111283883" target="_blank">Lilla LoCurto and Bill Outcault</a>.
      The installation featured a contemporary, animated recreation of Hiram Powers' 
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Greek_Slave" target="_blank"> <i>The Greek Slave</i></a> 
      which is a statue of an enchained woman. LoCurto and Outcault's version of the sculpture featured 
      an older woman than the original sculpture, and was part of an overall exhibition that 
      discussed modern sexism, ageism and ideas of the body. We imbued the sculpture with the 
      ability to track people looking at it and react to them by changing its posture. 
      I helped with the sculpture's hardware and Computer Vision.
