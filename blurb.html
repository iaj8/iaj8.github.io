      Hello! My name is Ishaan. The greatest moment of my life was when the 
      <a href="https://www.economist.com/united-states/2020/06/13/a-birdwatchers-app-inspires-a-field-guide-to-protesters-symbols" target="_blank">Economist</a> 
      referred to me as 
      "Mr Jhaveri, an amateur birdwatcher".
      <br>
      <br>
      I am a computer scientist with experience in Machine Learning,
      Natural Language Processing, Networks, Cybersecurity, Technology Law, and Full-Stack, Android
      and iOS Development. I am interested in investigating the influence technology systems have
      on news and the spread of information through society.
      <br>
      <br>
      I have been working as a Computational Research Fellow at the Tow Center for
      Digital Journalism at Columbia University's Graduate School of Journalism since October 2018. 
      I primarily work on a project called
      <a href="https://www.niemanlab.org/2020/06/vizpol-takes-a-cue-from-bird-watching-apps-to-help-journalists-identify-unfamiliar-political-symbols/" target="_blank">VizPol</a>,
      an app designed to provide journalists with contextual information about unfamiliar graphic symbols 
      they may encounter during field reporting, especially during live events, protests, and rallies. 
      By offering journalists some additional information about these symbols 
      (or just alerting them to the fact that a symbol may have broader political connotations) the 
      VizPol app supports more accurate, effective reporting on an increasingly complex political landscape.
      <br>
      <br>
      I have a BA and M.Eng. from Cornell University in Computer Science (with a minor in English).
      After graduating in 2018 I interned as a 
      <a href="https://kinja.com/ishaanjhaveri" target="_blank">Data Journalist</a>
      on the Special Projects Desk at
      Gizmodo Media Group (now called G/O Media).
      <br>
      <br>
      I have lived in India, England, upstate New York and now Manhattan.
