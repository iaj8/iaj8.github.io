  <h3>About Me</h3>
  <p id="blurbTextArea">
      I am Masters of Engineering student at Cornell University,
      a computer scientist with experience in Machine Learning, Natural Language Processing,
      Networks and Security and a rapidly growing interest in journalism.
      I have lived in India, England and now upstate New York. I am primarily interested in studying
      the influence technology systems have on news and the spread of information through society.
      <br>
      <!-- I am currently working on PROJECT DETAILS WILL BE UPDATED 2/21! -->
      When I am not working, I am usually tinkering around in Cornellâ€™s Rapid Prototyping Lab
      or trying to find anyone at all to go bird watching with me.
