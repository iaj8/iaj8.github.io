      Hello! My name is Ishaan. The greatest moment of my life was when the
      <a href="https://www.economist.com/united-states/2020/06/13/a-birdwatchers-app-inspires-a-field-guide-to-protesters-symbols" target="_blank">Economist</a>
      referred to me as
      "Mr Jhaveri, an amateur birdwatcher".
      <br>
      <br>
      I am a writer and computer scientist (and bird photographer!) with experience in Machine Learning, Computer Vision, Data Scraping,
      Natural Language Processing, Networks, Cybersecurity, Technology Law, OSINT, and Full-Stack, Android
      and iOS Development. I am currently a
      <a href="https://www.nytco.com/person/ishaan-jhaveri/" target="_blank">fellow</a>
      on the
      <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/spotlight/visual-investigations" target="_blank">Visual Investigations</a>
      team at the New York Times,
      where I use computational methods to build tools and approaches to open-source and visual investigations.
      Before this, I was a Computational Research Fellow at the Tow Center for
      Digital Journalism at Columbia University's Graduate School of Journalism.
      <br>
      <br>
      At the Tow Center, I worked on a project called
      <a href="https://www.niemanlab.org/2020/06/vizpol-takes-a-cue-from-bird-watching-apps-to-help-journalists-identify-unfamiliar-political-symbols/" target="_blank">VizPol</a>,
      an app designed to provide journalists with contextual information about unfamiliar graphic symbols
      they may encounter during field reporting, especially during live events, protests, and rallies.
      By offering journalists some additional information about these symbols
      (or just alerting them to the fact that a symbol may have broader political connotations) the
      VizPol app supports more accurate, effective reporting on an increasingly complex political landscape.
      <br>
      <br>
      My work on VizPol has drawn me to visual reporting and leveraging open-source intelligence (OSINT) techniques. I
      took an OSINT course with <a href="https://www.bellingcat.com/"target="_blank">Bellingcat</a> in
      June 2020. Moving forward I am particularly interested in reporting on protests, continuing to build computational tools to
      help journalists report on protests and other types of visual reporting, and studying the use of visual and
      computer vision technologies in newsrooms.
      <br>
      <br>
      I have a BA and M.Eng. from Cornell University in Computer Science (with a minor in English).
      After graduating in 2018 I interned as a
      <a href="https://kinja.com/ishaanjhaveri" target="_blank">Data Journalist</a>
      on the Special Projects Desk at
      Gizmodo Media Group (now called G/O Media).
      <br>
      <br>
      I'm from Mumbai and now live in Brooklyn.
